        <h2>Purchases</h2>

          If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through
          Services (“<dfn>Purchase</dfn>”), you may be asked to supply certain information
          relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your credit card

          your shipping information.
        </p>
        <p>
          You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any
          credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase;
          and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct and
          complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may employ the use of third-party services for the purpose of
          facilitating payment and the completion of Purchases. By submitting your
          information, you grant us the right to provide the information to these

        </p>
      </section>
 
      <section>
        <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>
          Some parts of Services are billed on a subscription basis
          (“<dfn>Subscription(s)</dfn>”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and
          periodic basis (“<dfn>Billing Cycle</dfn>”). Billing cycles are set either on a
          monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select
          when purchasing a Subscription.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew
          under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Zenthropic LLC cancels
          it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online
          account management page or by contacting Zenthropic LLC customer support team.
        </p>
        <p>
          A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the
          payment for your subscription. You shall provide Zenthropic LLC with accurate
          and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip
          code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting
          such payment information, you automatically authorize Zenthropic LLC to charge
          all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment
          instruments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Zenthropic LLC will
          issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within
          a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing
          period as indicated on the invoice.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Free Trial</h2>
        <p>
          Zenthropic LLC may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free
          trial for a limited period of time (“<dfn>Free Trial</dfn>”).
        </p>
        <p>
          You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up
          for Free Trial.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free Trial, you
          will not be charged by Zenthropic LLC until Free Trial has expired. On the
          last day of Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you
          will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type
          of Subscription you have selected.
        </p>
        <p>
          At any time and without notice, Zenthropic LLC reserves the right to (i)
          modify Terms of Service of Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial
          offer.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Fee Changes</h2>
        <p>
          Zenthropic LLC, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify
          Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will
          become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zenthropic LLC will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change
          in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your
          Subscription before such change becomes effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your continued use of Services after Subscription fee change comes into
          effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee
          amount.
        </p>

        <h2>Refunds</h2>

        <h2>Limitation Of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="conspicuous">
            Except as prohibited by law, you will hold us and our officers, directors,
            employees, and agents harmless for any indirect, punitive, special, incidental,
            or consequential damage, however it arises (including attorneys' fees and all
            related costs and expenses of litigation and arbitration, or at trial or on
            appeal, if any, whether or not litigation or arbitration is instituted), whether
            in an action of contract, negligence, or other tortious action, or arising out
            of or in connection with this agreement, including without limitation any claim
            for personal injury or property damage, arising from this agreement and any
            violation by you of any federal, state, or local laws, statutes, rules, or
            regulations, even if Company has been previously advised of the possibility of
            such damage. except as prohibited by law, if there is liability found on the
            part of Company, it will be limited to the amount paid for the products and/or
            Services, and under no circumstances will there be consequential or punitive
            damages. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of punitive,
            incidental or consequential damages, so the prior limitation or exclusion may
            not apply to you.

          If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent
          jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such
          provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the
          remaining provisions of Terms will continue in full force and effect.
