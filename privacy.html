        <p>
          Our mission at Zenthropic is to create <em>Software for Humans</em>. We assume that
          your privacy is important to you, so it's important to us too. We also care about
          your time, mental energy and emotional state – we've done our best to make this
          policy clear, easy to read and as short as possible. Please let us know if you
          have any feedback or recommended improvements!
        </p>
        <p>
          This policy applies to all websites and web applications operated by Zendeavor LLC,
          including
          <a href="https://www.zenthropic.com">zenthropic.com</a>,
          <a href="https://www.zendeavor.net">zendeavor.net</a> and

        <h2>Privacy Pledge</h2>
        <p>
          We make every reasonable effort to keep your data private and secure. We will
          never sell your data to anyone. Our use of your data is always and only in order
          to provide our services to you. We only share your data with third parties in
          order to provide our services to you or with your consent. We will make every
          reasonable effort to ensure that the people and third-party services we employ
          and partner with have policies and practices that are consistent with this
          pledge.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>What personal data do you collect and why?</h2>
        <p>
          As a principle, we collect the minimum amount of personal data needed in order
          to provide our services effectively.
        </p>

        <h3>Name and Email</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To sign up for an account, we collect your name and email address.
          </li>
          <li>
            We use your name to engage with you in a more personal way. If you prefer not to
            share your real name, please feel free to use a pseudonym.
          </li>
          <li>
            We use your email (along with a password) to authenticate you – e.g., to sign
            you into our services.
          </li>
          <li>
            We use your name and email to communicate with you for account maintenance and
            support purposes – e.g., to confirm your email address, reset your password,
            provide customer support, gather feedback or provide important updates about our
            services.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Usage Data</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We track usage data to better understand how people use our services. This data
            helps us understand usage trends, what features are being used, issues and
            frustration points, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Usage data may include information such as your computer’s or mobile device’s
            Internet Protocol address (IP address), operating system, browser type, browser
            version, the pages of our websites that you visit, the time and date of your
            visit, the time spent on those pages and other diagnostic data.
          </li>
          <li>
            We currently use Google Analytics for usage tracking. For more information on
            Google Analytics’ policies and privacy safeguards, please see the following
            Google Analytics help pages:
            <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/4597324?hl=en&ref_topic=1008008">Analytics
              policies</a>,
            <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/2919631?hl=en&ref_topic=1008008">Data
              privacy and security</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            We never share your name, email address or any other personally identifiable
            information (PII) with Google Analytics.
          </li>
          <li>
            To consistently identify the same user across different devices or browsers,
            we provide Google Analytics with an anonymous user id. This is a randomly
            generated id that is unique to Zendeavor – it cannot be used by Google
            Analytics or anyone else to determine your actual identity or to track you
            across other websites or services.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you prefer not to have your usage data anonymously tracked, you can use a
            built-in browser feature or browser extension to prevent tracking. We do ask
            you to consider allowing usage tracking, as it helps us improve our products
            for you and other users.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the future, we may use aggregate anonymized usage data to generate
            feedback, guidance and recommendations within our products. The results of our
            analyses and models will never be shared with third-parties or used to market
            other products or services to you.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Who do you share my data with?</h2>
        <p>
          As stated in our Privacy Pledge, we never sell your personal data to anyone,
          period. We won't sell Zenthropic LLC or any of our relevant data assets to
          another entity without a contractual commitment from the new owner to abide by
          this same pledge. We will also notify you of the sale of the company or
          relevant assets before being transferred to a new owner, providing you an
          opportunity to evaluate the new owner and have your data excluded upon your
          request.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our web applications use various third-party services in order to provide our
          services to you. We make every reasonable effort to select vendors and
          services that are consistent with our Privacy Pledge (in relation to the
          services we use and the manner in which we use them). We limit the data that
          is shared with these parties to the minimum that is required for us to
          effectively provide our service, and use appropriate security measures to
          protect your data.
        </p>
        <p>
          We comply with US law enforcement requests for data (when supported by
          relevant warrant, criminal subpoena or court order). Unless legally prevented
          from doing so, we’ll inform you when such requests are made.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How do you store and protect personal data?</h2>
        <p>
          We build and run our applications on a modern, cloud-native architecture. We
          employ industry trusted solutions and apply the security best practices
          recommended by our vendors. We believe this is the best way to keep your
          data secure. All user-specific data and content is encrypted in-transit
          using industry-standard
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>
          and encrypted at-rest using 256-bit
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite our best efforts to select proven solutions and follow vendor's
          security guidance, we recognize the potential for a security flaw in our
          provider's software or in our implementation of it. If we ever become aware
          of a data breach, we will take all reasonable measures to address and
          mitigate the issue as quickly as possible and to notify customers in a
          transparent and timely manner.
